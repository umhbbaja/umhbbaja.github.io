                <h2>COMPETITION</h2><br>
                <p>SAE Baja is a collegiate competition organized by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE). The events typically take place towards< 
                    the end of the spring and fall semesters. Teams compete with their newly designed vehicles in a variety of dynamic challenges, 
                    including an endurance race, maneuverability course, sled pull, hill climb, acceleration tests, and more. Additionally, the vehicles 
                    are judged in several static events, such as design evaluation, sales presentations, cost analysis, and other categories.</p><br>                
                <h5>STATIC EVENTS</h5><br>
                <p>The first day of the competition is dedicated to static events, along with a thorough technical inspection. Teams participates in a 
                    sales pitch, a cost analysis, and a design presentation.</p><br><p>During the sales presentation, we market our vehicle to a panel of industry 
                    experts, highlighting its specialized features. In the design segment, teams showcase the extensive design work, 
                    research, and testing we've conducted throughout the year to technical judges. Meanwhile, during the technical inspection, judges 
                    meticulously examine every detail of the vehicles to ensure they complies with all competition rules and specifications.</p><br>
                <h5>DYNAMIC EVENTS</h5><br>                
                    <p>On the second and third days of the competition, teams participate in a series of dynamic events. The second day features time trials, 
                    including acceleration, hill climb or sled pull, maneuverability, and suspension and traction tests. Each of these events is designed 
                    to assess the performance of specific components of the vehicles.</p><br> 
                    <p>The final day is dedicated to the endurance race, the highlight of the 
                    competition. In this four-hour race, all teams' cars compete head-to-head on the track. This event is the culmination of all the previous 
                    challenges and carries the most significant weight in the overall scoring.</p>>
